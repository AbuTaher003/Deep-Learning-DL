# Deep Learning Notes & Code (Bangla)

This repository contains my **personal deep learning study notes and implementations**, written in **Bangla**, along with runnable code examples.

I usually start by learning a topic from tutorials, courses, or documentation, and then rewrite everything **in my own words** to make sure I truly understand the concepts. These notes are not copied summaries — they are created as part of my learning process.

## 📌 Why this repository exists

- To deeply understand deep learning concepts by explaining them in my native language  
- To connect theory with practical code  
- To build a long-term reference for myself  
- To help others who prefer learning deep learning concepts in Bangla

## 📂 Contents

This repository covers both **theoretical intuition** and **hands-on implementation**, including:

- Neural Networks fundamentals  
- Activation functions and loss functions  
- Backpropagation and optimization  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Training deep learning models using TensorFlow  
- Practical experiments and visualizations  

Each topic includes:
- Clear Bangla explanations  
- Mathematical intuition (where necessary)  
- Python code with comments  
- Small experiments to verify understanding

## 🧠 Learning Approach

My approach for each topic is:

1. Study the concept from reliable sources  
2. Re-explain the idea in Bangla using simple language  
3. Implement the concept from scratch or using frameworks  
4. Experiment with the code to observe behavior and results  

This helps me move beyond memorization and focus on **why things work**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚠️ Note

These notes are **learning-oriented**, not polished course material.  
There may be improvements or refinements as my understanding grows.

## 🚀 Related Work

Alongside these notes, I also work on **end-to-end deep learning projects**, including:
- Computer Vision applications  
- Handwritten data recognition  
- Real-world model deployment  

Those projects are maintained in separate repositories.
